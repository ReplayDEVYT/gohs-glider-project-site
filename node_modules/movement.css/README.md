# Welcome to Movement.css!
At it's most basic level, you can use `data-m` attributes inside of your HTML to give an animation to your element. For example: `<h1 data-m="scale">Hello World!</h1>`. You can view a full list of all of the animations and see what they look like at [movement.samalander.dev](https://movement.samalander.dev/)

## Install Movement.css
Installing movement.css can be done in two different ways. Through NPM, or by linking the stylesheet in your `<head>` element. Feel free to use in your sites with or without credit.

### Use via NPM
Install the package

```npm i movement.css```

Import the package in your code

```import 'movement.css'```

### Use via CDN
Add the following code to your `<head>` element:

```<link href="https://unpkg.com/movement.css/movement.css" rel="stylesheet">```

## Customizing the Animations
You can also add other values to your movement elements. Current options are:
- `data-m-duration`
- `data-m-delay`
Movement accepts values in seconds in 0.1 increments and 0.25 increments up to 10 seconds. Examples:
- `data-m-delay="9.3"` will result in a delay of 9.3 seconds
- `data-m-delay="3.75"` will result in a delay of 3.75 seconds
- `data-m-delay="1.2s"` will not work, as it unnecessarily includes the "s"
- `data-m-delay="11"` will not work, as it exceeds 10 seconds
- `data-m-delay="1.15"` will not work, as it only works in 0.1 and 0.25 increments
If a value doesn't exist or doesn't work, movement will default to 1.5 seconds.
